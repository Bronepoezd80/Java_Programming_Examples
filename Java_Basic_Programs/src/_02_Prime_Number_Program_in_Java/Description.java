        Prime Number Program in Java
        Prime number in Java: Prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and
        divided by 1 or itself only. In other words, prime numbers can't be divided
        by other numbers than itself or 1. For example 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17....
        are the prime numbers.
        
        Note: 0 and 1 are not prime numbers. The 2 is the only even prime number
        because all the other even numbers can be divided by 2.
